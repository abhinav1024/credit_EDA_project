# credit_EDA_project


### PROJECT OBJECTIVE:
This case study aims to identify patterns which indicate if
a client has difficulty paying their installments which may
be used for taking actions such as denying the loan,
reducing the amount of loan, lending (to risky applicants)
at a higher interest rate, etc. This will ensure that the
consumers capable of repaying the loan are not rejected.
Identification of such applicants using EDA is the aim of
this case study.
